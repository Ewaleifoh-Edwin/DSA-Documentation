This is the beginning of my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis course with Incubator.

## INTRODUCTION TO EXCEL
In the first week of our leaning journey we were introduced generally to Data Analysis, The major applications that are used for analysis of data. Major terminologies were also introduced to us. 
The next week following, we started with basic excel- this introduced us to "cell" in excel, worksheet and workbook.In the course of the week we learnt how to feed data into cells, additions, subtractions, divisions etc alongside other basic formulars in excel.
By the end of that first month of our learning we were already working on advanced excel and using major functions like the "if function", pivot , charts etc.

## INTRODUCTION TO STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE - SQL
